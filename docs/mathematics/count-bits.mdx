## Introduction

In this article, we will see how to count number of bits in a number. We are given a number and we have to count the number of bits in its binary representation.

## Explanation 

We are given a number and we have to print the number of bits in binary representation of that number.

#### Example 1

```
Given number: 6
Binary representation of given number(6)=110
So number of bits in 6 is 3
Print 3
```
## Algorithm

For count number of bits in a number, we follow the following algorithm:

- First, we convert the number into its binary representation.

- Count number of bits in binary representation.

- Print the value of count.

## Code

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cpp"
  values={[
    { label: 'C++', value: 'cpp', },
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="cpp">

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

//function for counting number of bits
int count_bits(int n)
{
  //initialize count with 0
   int count=0;
   
   //  counting number of bits in binary representation of number
   while(n!=0)
   {
     count++;
     n=n/2;
   }
   return count;
}

//main function
int main()
{
  int n;

  //Taking number as input
  cout<<"Enter the number: ";
  cin>>n;

  //Printing count of bits of given number
  cout<<count_bits(n)<<endl;
  return 0;
}

```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="py">

```python   
# function count_bits for counting number of bits in binary representation
def count_bits(n):
    
    # initialize count with 0
    count=0
    while(n!=0):
      count+=1
      n=n//2
    
    return count
  
# Taking number as input 
n = int(input("Enter the number: "))
#Printing count of bits of given number 
print(count_bits(n))
   
    
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Sample Input and Output

#### Input :

```
Enter the number: 10

```
#### Output :

```
4
```

## Complexity Analysis
 
- Time Complexity: `O(logn)`

- Space Complexity: `O(1)`

where `n` is the number of elements.
