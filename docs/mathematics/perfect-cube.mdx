## Introduction

In this article, we will see how to check that the given number is perfect cube or not. A perfect cube is a number which is equal to the number, multiplied by itself, three times.

## Explanation 

In this, we have to check that the given number is perfect cube or not. For that first we calculate the floor of cube root of that number then we multiply with same calculated cube root three times. If the result is equal to the given number then it is the perfect cube.

#### Example 1

```
Given number x = 216
In the above example, we are given an number.
We have to check whether the given number is perfect cube or not.
First calculate the floor value of cube root of that number and store in res variable.
int res = floor(cube root(x))
res = 6
Now, multiply res*res*res and check whether the given number is equal to res*res*res or not.
In this case it is equal so print Yes.

```

#### Example 2

```
Given number x = 130
In the above example, we are given an number.
We have to check whether the given number is perfect cube or not.
First calculate the floor value of cube root of that number and store in res variable.
int res = floor(cube root(x))
res = 5
Now, multiply res*res*res and check whether the given number is equal to res*res*res or not.
res*res*res=125 and given number is 130.
In this case it is not equal so print No.

```

## Algorithm

For checking whether the given number is perfect cube or not, we follow the following steps:

* Initialise a variable res.

* Calculate the floor value of cube root of number and store into res.

* Calculate res*res*res and check given number is equal to res*res*res or not.

* Print Yes if equal otherwise print No.

## Complexity Analysis
 
- **Time Complexity:** `O(logn)`

- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

where `n` is the number of elements in array .
