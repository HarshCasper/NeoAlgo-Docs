## Introduction

Divisor of a number `n` refers to a number less than or equal to `n` which perfectly divides `n`. The Divisor is also called a Factor. `1` is the divisor of every number. Prime Numbers only have two divisors one and the number itself. The Sum of divisors refers to the sum of numbers in the range `[1 to n]` which perfectly divides `n`. It can be obtained by slightly modifying the code of count of divisors.

## Explanation 

We will make a `sum` variable and initialize it to zero. Then we will iterate from one to the square root of `n`. Whenever we find that the `n` is divisible by the current number on which we are iterating we will add the current number and will also add quotient obtained by dividing the given number `n` by the current number to `sum` only if it is not similar to the current number. 

Let's have one example: 
```
num = 9
range = [1,3]
sum = 0

Iteration 1:
i=1
divisors = 1 , 9/1=9
sum = sum + 1 + 9 = 10

Iteration 2:
i=2
9 is not divisible by i

Iteration 3:
i=3
divisors = 3 , 9/3=3
sum = sum + 3 = 13
Here we will increase the sum by i only as i is equal to sqrt(num) 
```

## Algorithm

* We will make a `sum` variable and initialize it to `0`.

* We will make a variable `i` iterate it on the range `[1, sqrt(n)]`. 

* If `n` is divisible by `i` and is not equal to `sqrt(n)` we will add both `i` and `n/i` to `sum` as both `i` and `n/i` will be the divisor of `n` as `n*(n/i) = n` and `i` lies on the left side of `sqrt(n)` and `n/i` on the right.

* If `n` is divisible by `i` and is equal to `sqrt(n)` we will add only `i` to `sum` as both `n` and `n/i` will be the same.

## Complexity Analysis

`n` is the given number.

- Time Complexity:

  - **Best Case**: `O(sqrt(n))`
  - **Average Case**: `O(sqrt(n))`
  - **Worst Case**: `O(sqrt(n))`

- Space Complexity: `O(1)`
