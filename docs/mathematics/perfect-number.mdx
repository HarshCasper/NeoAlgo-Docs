## Introduction

Perfect Number is a positive number whose sum of the positive divisors, excluding the number itself is equal to the number itself. The sum of divisors of a number, excluding the number itself, is known as its aliquot sum, So a perfect number is a number that is equal to its aliquot sum. Perfect Number can also be defined as a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors including itself.

## Explanation

Consider a number `6`. The divisors of 6(excluding itself) is `1`, `2`, `3`. Thier sum `1` + `2` + `3` = `6`, So `6` is a perfect number.

Consider Another Example, `n` = `28`. The divisors of `28`(excluding itself) are `1`, `2`, `4`, `7`, `14`.
Thier Sum

```
1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28
```

Hence 28 is a Perfect number.

## Algorithm

Let us assume that the given number be `num`,

-   Declare a variable `sum` and set its value to 0
-   Set i = 1
-   Iterate a While loop till `i` is less than the given number `num`
    -   If `num` is divisible by i, Do
        -   Set the value of `sum` as `sum + i`
-   If `sum` is equal to `num`, Do
    -   Return True
-   Else Return False

/*
Perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.
For example: 6 is the first perfect number
Proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3
Sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
Hence 6 is a perfect number.

## Complexity Analysis

-   Time complexity - `O(n)`, where `n` is the given number
-   Space complexity - `O(1)`
