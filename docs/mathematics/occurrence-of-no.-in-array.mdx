## Introduction

In this article, we will see how to count the occurrence of a number in a given set of data. Occurrence or frequency means how many times a number is present in a given set of data.

## Explanation 

In this, we have to count the number of times a given element is present in an array that means if an element is present 4 times in the array then we have to print 4. If element is not present then it prints zero.

#### Example 1

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8Gwk5QG.png" width="500" height="50"/>

```
Given arr[8]= | 2 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 4 | 5 | 2 | 3 |
Given number: 3
So we iterate on whole array 
And increase the count if current number is equal to 3
So after traversing the whole array it prints the count=2 
That means 3 is present 2 times
If number is not present then it returns zero.
```
## Algorithm

For counting occurrence of an element in array, we follow the following algorithm:

* First, we initialize a count variable with 0.

* Iterate on whole array and increase the count by 1 when our current element is equal to given element.

* If element is not present print Invalid.

* Otherwise display the value of count.

    { label: 'C++', value: 'cpp', },
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="cpp">

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

//function for counting occurrence
int count_occurrence(int x,int a[],int n)
{
  //initialize count with 0
   int count=0;
   
   //iterating on whole array
   for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
   {
     if(a[i]==x)
     {
       count++;
     }
   }
   return count;
}

//main function
int main()

  //Taking size as input

  //Taking elements of array
  for(int i=0;i<n;i++)

    cin>>a[i];
  }

  cout<<"Enter the no. of which you want to count the occurrence: ";
  cin>>x;
  //Printing occurrence of given number
  cout<<count_occurrence(x,a,n)<<endl;

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="py">

```python   
def countOccurrences(arr, n, x):
    res = 0
    for i in range(n-1):
        if x == arr[i]:
            res += 1
    return res
  
# Taking size as input 
n = int(input("Enter the size of array: "))
data = []

# Taking array element as input
d = int(input("Enter the elements of array: "))
for i in range(n-1):
    data.append(int(input()))
x = int(input("Enter the no. of which you want to print the occurrence: "))  

  #Printing the occurrence of given number 
print(countOccurrences(data,n,x))
   
    
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Sample Input and Output

#### Input :

```
Enter the size of array: 8
Enter the elements of array: 2 4 3 2 4 5 2 3
Enter the no. of which you want to print the occurrence: 3

```
#### Output :

```
2
```

## Complexity Analysis
 
- Time Complexity: `O(n)`

  where `n` is the number of elements.

- Space Complexity: `O(1)`
