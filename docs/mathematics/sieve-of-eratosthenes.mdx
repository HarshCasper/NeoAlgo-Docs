## Introduction

The sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. It is computationally highly efficient algorithm.

## Explanation

Let us take the number `n = 100` , so we create list from `2` to `100` . According to the algorithm , we mark all the numbers which are divisible by `2` which are greater than or equal to the square of it . Then we move to the next number `3` , we mark all the numbers which are divisible by `3`  which are greater than or equal to the square of it. we continue this process until the square of the number is greater than `n`. The numbers which are unmarked in the list are the prime numbers less than `n`.

## Algorithm

- Make a boolean list `l` of length `n+1` and initialise all entries to true
- loop from `p = 2` until `p*p <= n`
    - if `p` th entry in the list is true, then
        - loop from `i = p*p` until `i <= n` increment `i` with `p`
            - make the `i` th position of `l` as false
- The prime numbers are the numbers which are marked are true in `l`

## Sample Input and Output

#### Input

```
Enter the number upto which prime numbers are to be computed: 25
```

#### Output

```
The prime numbers less than 25 is
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23
```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity - O(`n*(log(log(n)))`)
- Space complexity - O(`n`)
