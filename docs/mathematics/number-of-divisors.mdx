## Introduction

In this article, we will learn about count the number of divisors of a given number.
Let us say, You are given a number `20`. `20` has `6` divisors. Thus, count the number of divisors of any given number.


## Explanation

Let us have one example:

```
Let us say, you are given a number 100. 100 has 9 divisors. They are 1,2,4,5,10,20,25,50 and 100.
Now, we will take square root of 100, it's 10. If we run a loop from 1 to 10, we will get all 9 divisors of
100. Thus we have to count the number of divisors.
```

## Algorithm

 - Firstly we will have to take square root `âˆš` of our given number.
 - Let us say, given number is `100`. so it's square root is `10`.
 - Now run a loop from `1` to `9`.
 - Inside our loop, if the `number` divides by any number, means their remainder is zero `0`, then we have found a pair of divisors.
 - We can increment our count by `2` as we found `2` divisors.
 - Now, we will check if the `number` is divided by `10` or not.
 - If the number divides, then we need to check whether the number is perfect square.
 - If the number is perfect square, then we can increment our count by `1`, as only we found `1` divisor only.
 - Else the number is not a perfect square, then we can increment our count by `2`, as only we found `2` divisors.
 - Thus we can count the number of divisors of any given number.
 - This algorithm reduces our time complexity from `O(N)` to `O(sqrt(N))`.
