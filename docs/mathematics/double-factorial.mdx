## Introduction

Double Factorial of a number `n` is defined as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n` which are having the same parity as of `n`. Parity can be even or odd. Double Factorial is defined for all non-negative integers. It is also called semifactorial. It is denoted by `!!` symbol. The value of `0!!` is `1`.

## Explanation 

For a non-negative integer say `n`, Double factorial of `n` is defined as follows:

If `n` is even:
```
DoubleFactorial(n) = n * (n - 2) * . . . . . 4  * 2
```

If `n` is odd:
```
DoubleFactorial(n) = n * (n - 2) * . . . . . 3  * 1
```

Let's have few examples: 
```
num = 6
res = 2 * 4 * 6 , as all of them are even
res = 48

num = 3
res = 1 * 3 , as all of them are odd
res = 3
```

## Algorithm

- Declare a variable `res` and initialize it to `1`.

- Multiply all the numbers in the range `1 to n` having the same parity as of `n` to `res`.

- Return `res`.
