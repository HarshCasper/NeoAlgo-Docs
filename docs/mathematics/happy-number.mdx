## Introduction

A number is called a happy number if it converges to 1 after a sequential operations
where in each step we replace the orginal number by the sum of the squres of its individual digits.   

## Explanation

When we have a digit given to us, we perform the operation, sum of squares of its individual
digits but in some case we might arrive at the same number which we already came across. In such cases
we can clearly see that it would never terminate so such numbers are not considered as happy numbers.

```
Let's have an example for each case

Input number : 13
Output       : Is Happy Number

Sequential steps :
1^2 + 3^2 = 10
1^2 + 0^2 = 01

Input number : 4
Output       : Not a Happy number

Sequential Steps :
0^2 + 4^2  = 16 
1^2 + 6^2  = 37
3^2 + 7^2  = 58
5^2 + 8^2  = 89
8^2 + 9^2  = 145
1^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 42
4^2 + 2^2  = 20
2^2 + 0^2  = 4

```

## Algorithmic Steps

- Impliment a function which computes the sum of squares of the individual digits and returns the sum.
- We assign 2 variables which keep track of the sum of squares in single iteration and two iterations 
  using the above function implimented repeatedly.
- We check if these two variables return us the same value.
- If they do so then we say it is a happy number else not.
