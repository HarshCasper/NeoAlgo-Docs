## Introduction

In this article, we will see how to check that the given number is perfect square or not. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the product of two equal integers.

## Explanation 

In this, we have to check that the given number is perfect square or not. For that first we calculate the floor of square root of that number then we multiply with same calculated square root. If the result is equal to the given number then it is the perfect square.

#### Example 1

```
Given number x = 225
In the above example, we are given an number.
We have to check whether the given number is perfect square or not.
First calculate the floor value of square root of that number and store in res variable.
int res = floor(square root(x))
res = 15
Now, multiply res*res and check whether the given number is equal to res*res or not.
In this case it is equal so print Yes.

```

#### Example 2

```
Given number x = 150
In the above example, we are given an number.
We have to check whether the given number is perfect square or not.
First calculate the floor value of square root of that number and store in res variable.
int res = floor(square root(x))
res = 12
Now, multiply res*res and check whether the given number is equal to res*res or not.
res*res=144 and given number is 150.
In this case it is not equal so print No.

```

## Algorithm

For checking whether the given number is perfect square or not, we follow the following steps:

* Initialise a variable res.

* Calculate the floor value of square root of number and store into res.

* Calculate res*res and check given number is equal to res*res or not.

* Print Yes if equal otherwise print No.

#### Input 2:

```
Enter the number: 150
```
#### Output 2:

```
Given number is Perfect Square: No
```
## Complexity Analysis
 
- **Time Complexity:** `O(sqrt(n))`

- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

where `n` is the number of elements in array .
