## Introduction

This is an extension of the already existing euclidean algorithm. Here also we find the GCD of the given two numbers. But here we also find additionally two numbers say `x`,`y`. The computation of these modular multiplicative inverse can come in handy in RSA public-key encryption method.

## Explanation

We find the `GCD` of two numbers same as in the euclidean algorithm but additionally we compute two numbers say `a`,`b` which can be uses to exprecess the GCD computed till then as `ax + by`.

Let's have one example: 
```
Input : a = 30, b = 20
Output: gcd = 10
x = 1, y = -1

Sequential steps:
30*1 + 20*(-1) = 10

Input : a = 35, b = 15
Output: gcd = 5
x = 1, y = -2

Sequential steps:
35*1 + 15*(-2) = 5
```

## Algorithm

- `x` and `y` are with respective to inputs `a` and `b`. 
- `a.x + b.y = gcd`.
- `x1` and `y1` are with respective to inputs `b%a` and `a`. 
-`(b%a).x1 + a.y1 = gcd`.
- We calculate the above values of `x1` and `y1` at every iteration.
- Then we put `b%a = (b - (⌊b/a⌋).a)` in above equation to get :
- `(b - (⌊b/a⌋).a).x1 + a.y1  = gcd`
- This equation can also be written as `b.x1 + a.(y1 - (⌊b/a⌋).x1) = gcd`
- So, the coeffitients 'a' and 'b' :
- `x = y1 - ⌊b/a⌋ * x1`  `y = x1`

## Sample Input and Output

### Input:

```
Enter the numbers whose GCD is to be found:
36
60
```

### Output:

```
GCD of numbers 60 and 36 is 12
```

## Complexity Analysis

```
Time  complexity -O(Log min(a, b))
Space complexity -O(1)
