## Introduction

The next prime number _p_ of a number _n_ is a number such that
- _p_ is greater than _n_.
- _p_ is a prime number.
- There are no prime numbers between _n_ and _p_.

## Explanation

Let's have one example:
```
Let n = 13, then the numbers after 13 are 14, 15, 16, 17 and so on.
Here 14, 15 and 16 are composite numbers. Hence, the next prime number is 17 which is
- Greater than 13.
- Is a prime number.
- And there are no prime numbers between 13 and 17.

```

## Algorithm

- Start with a number greater than _n_ i.e. `p = n+1`.
- Take `flag == false` initially and consider that _p_ is not a composite number.
- Now, in each iteration check if _p_ is composite or not.
- If it is, i.e. we found a factor for _p_ other than _1_ and _p_, then just set `flag == true`, increment p by 1 and break the loop.
- If `flag == false`, it means that _p_ has only two factors _1_ and _p_, i.e. _p_ is prime hence return it.
