## Introduction

Count of divisors refers to the count of numbers in the range `1 to n` which perfectly divides `n`.

## Explanation 

We will make a count variable and initialize it `0`. Then we will make a variable `i` and iterate it on the range `[1, sqrt(n)]` and will check whether `n` is divisible by `i` or not. If `n` is divisible by `i` and not equal to `sqrt(n)` we will increment the count by `2` as `i*(n/i) = n` and `i` lies on the left side of `sqrt(n)` and `n/i` on the right. If `n` is divisible by `i` and is equal to `sqrt(n)` we will increment the count by `1` only as both `i` and `n/i` will be same. 

Let's have one example: 
```
num = 9
range = [1,3]
cnt = 0

num = 9
i=1
divisors = 1 , 9/1=9
cnt = cnt + 2 =2

num = 9
i=2
9 is not divisible by i

num = 9
i=3
divisors = 3 , 9/3=3
cnt = cnt + 1 = 3
Here we will increase the cnt by 1 as i is equal to sqrt(num) 
```

## Algorithm

* We will make a count variable and initialize it to `0`.

* We will make a variable `i` iterate it on the range `[1, sqrt(n)]`. 

* If `n` is divisible by `i` and is not equal to `sqrt(n)` we will increment the count variable by `2` as `n` will also be divisible `n/i` as `n*(n/i) = n`.

* If `n` is divisible by `i` and is equal to `sqrt(n)` we will increment the count variable by `1` as both `n` and `n/i` are the same.

## Sample Input and Output

### Input :

```
Enter the number: 36
```
### Output :
```
The count of the divisors is: 9
```

## Complexity Analysis

`n` is the given number.

- Time Complexity:

  - **Best Case**: O (sqrt(n))
  - **Average Case**: O (sqrt(n))
  - **Worst Case**: O (sqrt(n))

- Space Complexity: O (1)
