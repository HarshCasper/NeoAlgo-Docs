## Introduction

Divisor of a number `n` refers to a number less than or equal to `n` which perfectly divides `n`. The Divisor is also called a Factor. `1` is the divisor of every number. Prime Numbers only have two divisors one and the number itself. Count of divisors refers to the count of numbers in the range `[1 to n]` which perfectly divides `n`.

## Explanation 

We will make a `cnt` variable and initialize it to zero. Then we will iterate from one to the square root of `n`. Whenever we find that the given number `n` is divisible by the current number on which we are iterating we will increase the `cnt` by `1` and will also check whether the quotient obtained by dividing the given number `n` by the current number is similar to the current number or not. If it is not similar we will again increase `cnt` by `1`.  

Let's have one example: 
```
num = 9
range = [1,3]
cnt = 0

Iteration 1:
i=1
divisors = 1 , 9/1=9
cnt = cnt + 2 =2

Iteration 2:
i=2
9 is not divisible by i

Iteration 3:
i=3
divisors = 3 , 9/3=3
cnt = cnt + 1 = 3
Here we will increase the cnt by 1 as i is equal to sqrt(num) 
```

## Algorithm

* We will make a `count` variable and initialize it to `0`.

* We will make a variable `i` and iterate it on the range `[1, sqrt(n)]`. 

* If `n` is divisible by `i` and `i` is not equal to `sqrt(n)` we will increment the `count` by `2` as `n` will also be divisible `n/i` as `n*(n/i) = n` and `i` lies on the left side of `sqrt(n)` and `n/i` on the right.

* If `n` is divisible by `i` and `i` is equal to `sqrt(n)` we will increment the `count` by `1` as both `n` and `n/i` are the same.

## Complexity Analysis

`n` is the given number.

- Time Complexity:

  - **Best Case**: `O(sqrt(n))`
  - **Average Case**: `O(sqrt(n))`
  - **Worst Case**: `O(sqrt(n))`

- Space Complexity: `O(1)`
