## Introduction

Binary Exponentiation is a trick that allows us to calculate `a` raise to the power of `b` in logarithmic time complexity. It is also called exponentiation by squaring. It can also be extended to Modular Exponentiation. Both `C++` and `Python` provide a built-in power function that works in `O(log N)` time complexity.

## Explanation 

The Power of two numbers is calculated by multiplying the base by itself, exponent times. `a` raise to the power `b` is denoted by `pow(a,b)`. The Power of an even number is always even and odd is always odd. Any number raised to power `0` is always `1`.

Here is the formula of the same:

```
pow(a,b) = a*a*a*a*a....b times
```

Here are the properties of the power:

```
pow(a,b) = pow(|a|,b), if a is negative and b is even
pow(a,b) = -pow(|a|,b), if a is negative and b is odd 
pow(a,0) = 1
pow(a,b) * pow(a,c) = pow(a,b+c)
pow(a,b) / pow(a,c) = pow(a,b-c)
```

Let's have one example: 

```
pow(2,5)
a = 2
b = 5
res = 1 

Iteration 1:
If ( b % 2 != 0) res = res * a = 2
b = b / 2 = 2 
a = a * a = 4

Iteration 2:
If (b % 2 != 0) res = res * a
b = b / 2 = 1 
a = a * a = 16

Iteration 3:
If (b % 2 != 0) res = res * a = 32
b = b / 2 = 0
a = a * a = 256
```

## Algorithm

- Declare a variable `res` and initialize it to `1`.

- If `b` is odd then multiply `res` with `a` and reduce `b` by `1`. 

- If `b` is even then multiply `a` with `a` and reduce `b` to `b/2`.

- Apply the previous two steps until `b` becomes `0`.

## Sample Input and Output

#### Input :

```
Enter the Base: 2
Enter the Exponent: 3
```

#### Output :

```
Power is: 8
```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: `O(log b)`, where`b` is the exponent

- Space Complexity: `O(1)`
