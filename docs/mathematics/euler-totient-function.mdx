## Introduction

Euler Totient Function gives the count of numbers from `1 to n` which are coprime with `n`. Two numbers are coprime if their highest common factor is `1`. `1` is coprime to every number. It is also called phi-function and represented as `ϕ(n)`.

## Explanation 

We can calculate the value of Euler function by iterating from `1 to n` and checking if the gcd of the current number with `n` is `1` or not.

Here are values of ϕ(n) for first 10 integers:
```
 n  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  7  |  9  |  10
ϕ(n)|  1  |  1  |  2  |  2  |  4  |  2  |  6  |  4
```

Properties:
```
ϕ(ab) = ϕ(a)⋅ϕ(b), where a and b are relatively prime
ϕ(ab) = ϕ(a)⋅ϕ(b)⋅(d/ϕ(d)), where a and b are not coprime and d = gcd(a,b)
```

Let's have one example: 
```
num = 5
cnt = 0 , to store the count of numbers which are coprime with `n`

Iteration 1:
i = 1
if (gcd(1,num) == 1)cnt++
cnt = 1

Iteration 2:
i = 2
if (gcd(2,num) == 1)cnt++
cnt = 2

Iteration 3:
i = 3
if (gcd(3,num) == 1)cnt++
cnt = 3

Iteration 4:
i = 4
if (gcd(4,num) == 1)cnt++
cnt = 4

Iteration 5:
i = 5
if (gcd(5,num) == 1)cnt++
cnt = 4
```

## Algorithm

- Declare a variable `cnt` and initialize it to `0`.
- Now iterate from `1 to n` and check if the current number is coprime with `n` or not and if it is coprime then increase the `cnt` by `1` . 
- Return `cnt`.
