## Introduction

A triangular number is a number that can be represented in the form of a triangular grid of points. This triangular grid should be an equilateral triangle. We need to check whether the number given by the user is a triangular number or not.

## Explanation 

Each row in a triangular grid formed by a triangular number contains the same number of points as the row number. The first row will contain `1` points, the second row will contain `2` points, the third row will contain `3` points, and so on. First few triangular numbers `1`, `3`, `6`, `10`.

Let's have one example: 
```
n = 6
total_points = 1 , total points in the triangle till now
row_point = 2 , point in the next row

Iteration 1:
total_points = total_points + row_point = 3
row_point = row_point + 1 = 3

Iteration 2:
total_points = total_points + row_point = 6
row_point = row_point + 1 = 4

n is a triangular number because total_points became equal to n
```

## Algorithm

- Initialize `total_points` to `1` and `row_point` to `2`.

- Keep on increasing the `total_points` by `row_point` and `row_point` by `1` until `total_points` becomes equal or greater than given number.

- If `total_points` becomes equal to `n` then it is triangular number.

## Sample Input and Output

#### Input :

```
Enter the Number: 6
```

#### Output :

```
Triangular Number
```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: `O(n)`

- Space Complexity: `O(1)`
