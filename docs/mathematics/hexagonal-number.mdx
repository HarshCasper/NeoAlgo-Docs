## Introduction

A Hexagonal number is a figurate number. A Figurate number is a number that can be represented by a regular geometrical arrangement of equally spaced points. The `nth` hexagonal number `Hn` refers to the count of distinct dots which can be used to draw the outlines of regular hexagonal pattern such that hexagons are overlaid to share one vertex. We are given a number `n` and we need to print the `nth` hexagonal number.

## Explanation 

Every hexagonal number is a triangular number and every odd triangular number is a hexagonal number. For calculating the `nth` hexagonal number just apply the formula given below. First few hexagonal numbers are `1`, `6`, `15`, `28`, `45`, `66`, `91`, `120`, `153`, `190`.

Formula: 
```
nth Hexagonal Number: n * (2 * n - 1) 
```

Test for Hexagonal Number:
```
We can test whether a positive integer `x` is a hexagonal number or not by calculating below expression:

n = (sqrt(8*x + 1) + 1) / 4

If n is integer then x is a hexagonal number
Else x is not a hexagonal number 
```

Let's have few examples: 
```
n = 1
1st hexagonal number = 1

n = 3
3rd hexagonal number = 15

n = 6
6th hexagonal number = 66
```

## Algorithm

- Return `n * (2 * n - 1)`.

if __name__ == "__main__":

    n = int(input("Enter the Number: "))

    print("Hexagonal Number is: ",hexagonal_number(n))
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Sample Input and Output

#### Input :

```
Enter the Number: 5
```

#### Output :

```
Hexagonal Number is: 45
```
