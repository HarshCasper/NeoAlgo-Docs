title: Number is Power of 2
slug: /mathematics/number-power-of-2

## Introduction

Some numbers can be represented as power of 2, such as `64` = `2^6`. But `22` can not be represented as power of 2.

## Explanation

Let us have one example:

```
Let us say we have a number = 256
The number can be expressed as: 256 = 2^8
As we can see, the number 256 is power of 2.
But let us take another number, say number = 567.
Since, it is an odd number.
As we can see, the number 567 is not power of 2.
```

## Algorithm

 - Given an integer, check whether it can represented as power of `2` or not.
 - If the number is power of `2`, then it's binary representation will contain only `1` setbit.
 - For example `16` = `10000` in binary representation. 
 - After subtracting 1 from the number all unset bits will become set and set bits will be unset.
 - For example `15` = `01111` in binary representation.
 - This two numbers bitwise AND `&` will be zero.
 - `10000 & (1000 - 1)` -> `0000`.
 - If the number is not Power of `2` , then their bitwise AND will not zero.
