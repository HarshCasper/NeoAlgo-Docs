## Introduction

Some Numbers can be represented as power of 2. Let us say `64` = `2^6`.
But some numbers can not be represented as power of 2. Such as `22`, `45` and so on.


## Explanation

Let us have one example:

```
Let us say, number  = 256
Number can be expressed as, 256 = 2^8
Clearly we see, the number 256 is power of 2.
But let's take another number, say number = 567.
Since , it is an odd number.
Clearly we see, the number 567 is not power of 2.
```

## Algorithm

 - Given a number `number` to check whether it can represented as power of `2` or not.
 - Well, if the number is power of `2`, then it's binary representation will contain only `1` setbit.
 - for example `16` = `10000` in binary representation. 
 - after subtracting 1 from the number all unset bits will become set and set bits will be unset.
 - for example `15` = `01111` in binary representation.
 - this two numbers bitwise AND `&` will be zero 
 - `10000 & (1000 - 1)` -> `0000`
 - if the number is not Power of `2` , then their bitwise AND will not zero.
