## Introduction

In this article, we will see how to calculate the product of the count of bits of each element present in the array.  

## Explanation 
In this, we are given an array. We have to calculate the product of bits of each element present in the array so first, we have to calculate the number of bits in each element then simply multiply them.
#### Example :

```
Given array  a[5]: { 3, 2, 4, 1, 5 }
Binary representation of 3 : 11
So no. of bits in 3 :  2

Binary representation of 2 : 10
So no. of bits in 2 :  2

Binary representation of 4 : 100
So no. of bits in 4 :  3

Binary representation of 1 : 1
So no. of bits in 1 :  1

Binary representation of 5 : 101
So no. of bits in 5 :  3

Product of all bits of each element : 2*2*3*1*3=36

```
## Algorithm

For calculating product of count of bits of each element in array, we follow the following algorithm:

* First, we will calculate the number of bits in binary representation of each element.

* Initialize product variable with 1 and keep multiply count of bits of each element.

* Print the value of product.

```python

def count_bits(n):
    
    # initialize count with 0
    count=0
    while(n!=0):
      count+=1
      n=n//2
    
    return count
  
# Taking size as input 
n = int(input("Enter the size of array: "))

#  Taking elements of array as input
print("Enter the elements of array: ")
data=[]
for i in range(n):
    data.append(int(input()))

# Initializing product variable with 1
product=1

# loop for calculating bits of each element present in array
for i in range(n):

  # calling count_bits function
  bits=count_bits(data[i]);
  product*=bits;

# Printing the value of product
print(product)
     
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Sample Input and Output

#### Input :

```
Enter the size of array: 5
Enter the elements of array: 3 2 4 1 5

```
#### Output :

```
36
```

## Complexity Analysis
 
- **Time Complexity:** `O(nlogn)`

- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

where `n` is the number of elements.
