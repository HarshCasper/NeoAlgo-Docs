## Introduction

Jump search, also known as block search is a searching algorithm for sorted lists. It locates an item by jumping ahead a fixed number of elements instead of traversing through each element. If a larger value than the search value is found, it backtracks and performs a linear search over the last block of elements. The fundamental advantage of this search, over the linear search, is that jump search doesn't traverse through every single element. Instead, it jumps ahead with a fixed number of elements and thus achieves a time complexity less than that of a linear search. Although the binary search has a better complexity, jump search overcomes this disadvantage by needing to backtrack only once, when compared to binary search which may need to backtrack up to `O(Log n)` times.

## Explanation

Jump Search creates a `block` and attempts to find the element in that block. If the element is found, a linear search is done on the elements of the block. Else, the block `jumps` ahead. The block size is dependent on the list size. If the size of the list is `n`, the block size is `√n` floored to the value.

Let's have one example: 

[![list-1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/jSXyNH1B/list-1.png)](https://postimg.cc/xXXkVznP)

Consider the above-sorted list. Let `n` denote the size of the list. Here, `n = 9`. Therefore, `√n (block size) is 3`. Let `5` be the element to be found.

[![list-2.png](https://i.postimg.cc/BZYy5FrL/list-2.png)](https://postimg.cc/23W2r18r)

Since the block size is `3`, jump `three` elements ahead. That is, from `A[0] to A[2]`. Since `A[2]` is not greater than `5`, the block jumps ahead.

[![list-3.png](https://i.postimg.cc/MKgFNSKz/list-3.png)](https://postimg.cc/HV4z8FyN)

The block had jumped from `A[2] to A[5]`. Since `A[5]` is greater than `5`, we perform a `linear search` on that block, but traversing backward.

[		![list-4.png](https://i.postimg.cc/QCw02QDf/list-4.png)](https://postimg.cc/RJ17fnNt)

The search element, `5`, is now found successfully.

## Algorithm

- Input the sorted list `A` and the search element `search`.
- Calculate the length of `A`, as `size`
- Calculate the block size, `step`, as the root of `size`.
- Compare `A[i+(step-1)] and search`.
	- If `search == A[i+(step-1)]`, return index `i+(step-1)`.
	- If `search < A[i+(step-1)]`, perform linear search on the sub-array `A[0] to A[i+(step-1)]`by traversing backwards and return the matching index. 
	- Else, jump to the next block and repeat the iteration.
- The above steps are repeated for `i` ranging from: `0` to `size`.
- If no matches, return `-1`.
