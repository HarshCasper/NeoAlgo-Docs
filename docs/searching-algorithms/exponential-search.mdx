## Introduction

A simple searching algorithm which also is based on usage of Binary Search technique. Just like binary search, this needs a sorted array to work. The key to this algorithm is finding the range in which the element should exist and then applying Binary Search on that range. We keep on doubling the index until we find the range in which the item exists.

## Explanation

For example:

Let's assume we have to search for 11 in this array -

| 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 11 | 13 | 15 | 17 | 19 |
|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|

- We start from first element at index 0, since its not the item we are searching for we move on to index = 1.
- From index = 1 we start a loop, where we compare `arr[index]` with 11 and keep doubling if the `arr[index] <= 11`.
- So this is how the range shortens-
    - index = 1, 3 <= 11 is true

    | 3 | 5 | 7 | 11 | 13 | 15 | 17 | 19 |
    |---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|

    - index = 2*1 = 2, 5 <= 11 is true

    | 5 | 7 | 11 | 13 | 15 | 17 | 19 |
    |---|---|----|----|----|----|----|

    - index = 2*2 = 4, 11 <= 11 is true

    | 11 | 13 | 15 | 17 | 19 |
    |----|----|----|----|----|

    - index = 2*4 = 8, 19 <= 11 is false
    So we have found our range that is from 8/2 = 4 to 8

    | 11 | 13 | 15 | 17 | 19 |
    |----|----|----|----|----|

## Algorithm

These are the main steps for this algorithm:
- Start with first element and check if its the one that needs to be searched.
- If not, start with the 2nd element (index = 1) and if the item is larger, double the index.
- Keep doubling till the item to be searched is lower than or equal to the element at the index, that is, till `item <= arr[index]`.
- Now the range from that `index / 2` to `index` is where the item exists if its present in the array. we start with half of `index` as we have already compared and found that the item is greater than half of `index`.
- Apply binary search on the above range to get the result.

## Sample Input and Output

#### Sample Input

## Complexity Analysis

- `n` is the size of the array.

- `i` is the index where the search key should be in the list.

- Time Complexity:

  - **Best Case**: O (1)
  - **Average Case**: O (log i)
  - **Worst Case**: O (log i)

- Space complexity: O(1)
