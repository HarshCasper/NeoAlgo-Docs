## Introduction

Interpolation Search is a technique to search a key in an array consisting of sorted and uniformly distributed values. By uniformly distributed we mean, the difference between two adjacent elements must be consistent. For example:

**Sorted but non-uniformly distributed array:**

The following array is sorted but not uniform distributed as the difference between adjacent elements is not the same:

| 1   | 5   | 8   | 9   | 12  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Sorted and uniformly distributed array:**

The following array is sorted and uniformly distributed as the difference between adjacent items is the same:

| 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Why Interpolation Search ?

The interpolation search is an improvement over the binary search. Here the values in a sorted array are uniformly distributed. In binary search, we always check the middle element to find the desired key. Unlike binary search, interpolation searches is performed at various locations depending on the value of the key being searched. For example, if the value of the key is closer to the last item, the interpolation search may start near the end.

The position to be searched is determined using the `probe position` formula.

```
pos = low + [ (x - arr[low]) * (high - low) / (arr[high] - arr[low])]

arr[] -> Array where elements need to be searched
x     -> Element to be searched
lo    -> Starting index in arr[]
hi    -> Ending index in arr[]
```

## Algorithm

- Calculate the value of `pos` using the probe position formula.
- If it is a match, return the index of the item, and exit.
- If the item is less than arr[pos], calculate the probe position of the left sub-array. Otherwise, calculate the same in the right sub-array.
- Repeat Step 1 to Step 3 until a match is found or the size of the sub-array reduces to zero.

## Complexity Analysis

- `n` is the number of elements in the array. Keep n between backticks

- Time Complexity:

  - **Best Case**: O (1)
  - **Average Case**: O (log log n)
  - **Worst Case**: O (n)

- Space Complexity: O (1)
