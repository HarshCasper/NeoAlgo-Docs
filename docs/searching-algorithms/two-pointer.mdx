## Introduction

This is an technique which comes to reduce complexity of a problem. The simple words to introduce it is
"In an sorted array there will be two pointer to solve the problem whether it can sum of three,two digit"

## Explanation

Let an sorted array(Note : This algorithm is for sorted array only to reduce time and space)
X = -1 0 2 3 7 9, now if we want the sum of any two digit which will be equal to my given number(say 5) without using
time or space of n*n. Let's see :

```
X = -1 0 2 3 7 9

Iteration 1:
   [-1 0 2 3 7 9]
     |         |
  point1   point2
  Check if = point1 + point2 == 5(given number)
`point1 + point2` > 5 but we have sorted array so if sum is greater then given numbers,
we will move `point2` so that we can decrease the sum of that.

 Iteration 2:
   [-1 0 2 3 7 9]
     |       |
 point1  point2
Check if = point1 + point2 == 5(given number)
`point1 + point2` > 5 but we have sorted array so if sum is greater then given numbers,
we will move `point2` so that we can decrease the sum of that.

Iteration 3:
  [-1 0 2 3 7 9]
    |     |
point1 point2
Check if = point1 + point2 == 5(given number)
`point1 + point2` < 5 but we have sorted array so if sum is less then given numbers,
we will move `point1` so that we can increase the sum of that.

Iteration 4:
  [-1 0 2 3 7 9]
      |   |
  point1 point2
Check if = point1 + point2 == 5(given number)
`point1 + point2` < 5 but we have sorted array so if sum is less then given numbers,
we will move `point1` so that we can increase the sum of that.

Iteration 5:
  [-1 0 2 3 7 9]
        | |
   point1 point2
Check if = point1 + point2 == 5(given number)
Here we found the sum of two digit which is equal to 5.

```

## Algorithm

Approach:

  - Input one array called `arr` .
  - Create two integer `i` and `j`, where `i` and `j` will be pointer as `point1` and `point2` respectively.
  - Check if sum of two digit `i`, `j` has result equal to given number.

## Sample Input and Output

#### Input

```
 Please enter length of the array :
 10
 Please enter value the sum you want to be :
 10
 enter array
 2 3 4 4 5 6 7 8 9 1
  ```

#### Output

```
The sum of these two digit 4,6 will be equal to 10
```
