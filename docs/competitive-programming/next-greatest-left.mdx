## Introduction

Given an array of numbers, find out the next greatest element to the left.

## Algorithm

- Declare an array and a stack
- If the stack is empty, then no element to the left is greater than the present element
- If the stack is not empty but the element present at the top of the stack is not greater than the current element then-
- Pop the stack till the stack is not empty or the top element of stack is greater than the current element
- If the stack is not empty and the element at the top of the stack is greater than the current element then push the topmost element to the stack

## Examples

#### Example 1

```
Let the array be 3, 2.
Traverse array from the left.
The stack is empty, so no greater element to the left of 3 and -1 is pushed to array.
Push 3 to stack.
For next element 2, compare the topmost element of the stack.
Topmost element is 3 which is greater than 2, so 3 is printed.
The resultant array is -1,3.
```

#### Example 2

```
Let the array be 1,2.
The stack is initially empty, so no greater element to the left of 1 and -1 is pushed to array.
1 is pushed into stack.
For next element 2, the topmost element of stack, 1 is compared which is less than 2.
1 is popped from stack.
Stack is now empty, so 2 has no greater element to its left.
The resultant array is -1,-1.
```

        v.push_back(-1);
        else if(s.empty() != true && s.top() > a[i])
        v.push_back(s.top());
        else if(s.empty() != true && s.top() <= a[i])
        {
            while(s.empty() != true && s.top() <= a[i])
            {
                s.pop();
            }
            if(s.empty() == true)
            v.push_back(-1);
            else if(s.top() > a[i])
            v.push_back(s.top());
        }
        s.push(a[i]);
    }
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cout << v[i] << " ";
}

//Driver Function
int main()
{
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the number of elements: ";
    cin >> n;
    int a[n];
    cout << "Enter the elements: ";
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> a[i];
    cout << "The next greatest element to the left of each element: \n";
    nextGreatestToLeft(a,n);
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Sample I/O

#### Input

```
Enter the number of elements: 4
Enter the elements: 5 2 4 6
```
#### Output

```
The next greatest element to the left of each element: 
-1 5 5 -1 
```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- Space complexity: O(n)
