## Introduction

Given a binary tree, print the nodes from left to right which are visible from the top.

## Explanation

Let us take an example of a tree so that we get a better understanding of this problem.

</p>

In the above picture, the nodes marked with a `✅` i.e. nodes `G, D, B, A, C and F` are visible from the top view of the binary tree. However, the nodes marked with a `❌` i.e nodes `H, E and I` are not visible from the top view of a binary tree because they are hidden by nodes `B, A and C` respectively.

So the top view of this binary tree will be `G D B A C F`.

## Algorithm

Here, we will use recursive approach to solve this problem.

* Check whether the node passed in recursive function is null; if yes, then return.
* Recursively print the left view of binary tree.
* Repeat Step 1.
* Recursively print the right view of binary tree.

## Sample Input and Output

#### Sample input

```
Enter values in a binary tree: 1 2 4 -1 -1 5 -1 -1 3 6 -1 -1 -1
```

#### Sample Output

```
Top view: 4 2 1 3 
```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: `O(N)` where `N` is the total number of nodes.
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`
