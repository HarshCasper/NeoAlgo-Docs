title: First occurence of 1 in a sorted array of 0 and 1
slug: /competitive-programming/first-occurence-1
---

## Introduction

Given an array of 0s and 1s in the sorted array, our objective is to find the position of the occurence of the first `1`.

## Explanation

Binary search algorithm is used in the problem. We divide the array continuously into halves and search for the first index of `1` in each subparts. Let us take an example to illustrate the same. Let the array be `0,0,1,1`.

## Algorithm

- Find the middle index. 
- Check whether the element at the middle index is `1` or not.
- Check whether the middle index is zero or whether the element at the position just before the middle index is zero or not.
- If the above conditions are true then the middle index is the first occurrence of `1` in the array.
- If the middle index is not zero and the element at the position just before the middle index is not zero:
    - Then repeat the above process for the subarray before the middle index if the middle element is `1`.
    - Then repeat the above process for the right subarray if the middle element is not `1`. 

## Examples

#### Example 1

```
Let the array be 0,1,1.
The lower index is 0 and upper index is 2.
The middle index is 1.
The element present at index 1 is 1 and the element before it is 0.
So the index 1 is the first occurence of first 1 in array. The position is 2.
```

#### Example 2

```
Let the array be 0,0.
The lower index is 0 and upper index is 1.
The middle index is 0.
The element at the middle index is 0. 
The lower index is changed to middle index+1.
However the lower index has become equal to the upper index. So -1 is returned. Occurence of 1 not found.
```

## Sample Input and Output

#### Input 

```
Enter the number of elements: 5
Enter only 1 and 0 in sorted order
1 1 1 1 1
```
### Output
```
Position of the first 1 = 1
```

### Input

```
Enter the number of elements: 3
Enter only 1 and 0 in sorted order
0 0 1
```

### Output
```
Position of the first 1 = 3
```
