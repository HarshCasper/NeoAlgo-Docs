## Introduction

In this article, we will learn about Bigmod Algorithm.
Let us say, You want to calculate the value of `2^60`. This can be calculated by applying Bigmod algorithm.


## Explanation

Let us have one example:

```
Let us say, you are given the base and power of a number, where base is 2 and power is 60.
To calculate the resulting value of 2^60, we will apply big mod algorithm. Thus recursively will calculate the value of 2^60.
The resulting value can be very big so we will mod the value by a number.

```

## Algorithm

 - First we will check whether the `power` is `0` or not.
 - If the `power` is `0`, then no matter what `base` is, the resulting value will always be `1`.
 - If the `power` is not `0`, then we will check if the `power` is odd or even.
 - Let us assume, `power` is even.
 - Then, we will divide the `power` each step by `2` and thus will call the function recursively.
 - As our resulting value can be very large, each step we will take the mod `%` the value by a large number.
 - When the `power` is odd, then we will take `power-1` and will call the function recursively.
 - Let us have one example: `base` is `2` and `power` is `6`.
 - As `power` is even, each step `power` will be look like this.
 - `2^6` = `2^3 * 2^3`.
 - `2^3` = `2^2 * 2`.
 - `2^2` = `2 * 2`.
 - Thus, we will get our resulting value.
