## Introduction

You are given n activities (from 0 to n-1) with their start and finish times. Select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person, 
assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time.

## Algorithm

- Take inputs of the starting times and ending times of each activity.
- Sort the activities according to the ending times in ascending times.
- For each activity, check whether the ending time of the activity is less than the starting time of the next.
- If it is so, then the activity can be performed otherwise not.

## Examples

#### Example 1

```
Let the starting and ending times be as follows:

Activity 1: Starting time: 10 Ending time: 20
Activity 2: Starting time: 12 Ending time: 15
Activity 3: Starting time: 20 Ending time: 30

Sort the array according to the ending times.

Activity 2: Starting time: 12 Ending time: 15
Activity 1: Starting time: 10 Ending time: 20
Activity 3: Starting time: 20 Ending time: 30

The ending time of the Activity 2 is greater than the activity 1, hence cannot be preformed.
Ending time of Activity 1 is equal to Activity 3 and so can be performed.
So maximum number of activities that can be performed are 2.
```

#### Example 2

```
Let the starting and ending times be as follows:
Activity 1: Starting time: 10 Ending time: 12
Activity 2: Starting time: 12 Ending time: 15

Sort the array according to the ending times.

Activity 1: Starting time: 10 Ending time: 12
Activity 2: Starting time: 12 Ending time: 15

The ending time of the Activity 1 is less than the starting time of the Activity 2.
Both tasks can be performed.
Maximum number of activities that can be performed are 2.
```
