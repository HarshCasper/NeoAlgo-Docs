## Introduction

Radix sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that behaves like **counting sort**. This algorithm doesn't require comparing elements like the other sorting methods. The numbers are sorted from the least significant digit to the most significant digit. For example, if we are dealing with unsorted numbers, we know that there are ten digits from 0 to 9 that are used to form any number. So we will need ten buckets labelled 0 to 9 to sort the unsorted numbers.

## Explanation

To understand the algorithm better, let us take an example of an unsorted array:

#### Step 1: Creating 10 Bins

We need to initialize 10 Bins because only ten digits are used to form any number.

#### Step 2: Drop Numbers  

In this step, check every number's last digit and drop them in the bins. For example, we see the value 300 at the 2nd position in the array, and we have to drop it inside the 0th bin as 0 is the last digit of 300.

#### Step 3: Remove Data

After we are done filling the buckets, we have to now remove the data one by one starting from the 0th bucket.

#### Step 4: Again Drop Numbers

After emptying the bucket, we saw that the numbers are not yet sorted. So, we have to drop them inside the buckets again, but this time, we will check every number's tenth place digit and drop them accordingly. This drop and empty step depend on the maximum number's digits. For example, in the given array, we have 840 as the maximum number. As it contains 3 digits, this method is applied 3 times starting from the least significant digit to the most significant digit.

#### Step 5: Remove Data

Repeat **Step 3**

#### Step 6: Again Drop Numbers

Repeat **Step 4**. This time we have to check every number's hundredth place digit and drop them accordingly.

#### Step 7: Remove Data

Repeat **Step 3**

#### Step 8: Final Step

After we empty the buckets, we have to store the values inside an array. Here's our final sorted array.

## Algorithm

For sorting an array of size n:
    
* Find the `MAX` number in the array.
* Initialize 10 queues each representing a bin/bucket for each digit from 0 to 9.
* Consider the least significant digit of each number and insert them in their respective queues based on this digit.
* Arrange the numbers from left to right from all queues.
* Repeat after Step 3 based on the next least significant digit.
* Keep repeating the above steps until all the numbers are sorted based on the most significant digit.

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: `O(dn)` 
- Space Complexity: `O(n)`

Here `d` is the maximum number of digits.
