## Introduction

Shell sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on insertion sort algorithm. Shell sort is the generalization of insertion sort which overcomes the drawbacks of insertion sort by comparing elements separated by a gap of several positions.

## Explanation

Shell sort divides the array in the form of ```N/2 , N/4 , â€¦, 1 (where N is the length of array)``` and then sorting is done. This breaking of sequence and sorting takes place until the entire array is sorted.

Let's take an example to understand.

| 12  | 15  | 50  | 10  | 35  | 19  | 11  | 44  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

#### Stage 1: Divide

In this stage the unsorted array is divided in the form of `N/2`. Here `N/2` is ```8/2 = 4```, which means the `0th` and `4th` elements, `1st` and `5th` and so on are compared and swapped if necessary.

Now after first stage the array is in this form:

| 12  | 15  | 11  | 10  | 35  | 19  | 50  | 44  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

#### Stage 2: Again Divide

In this stage the unsorted array is again divided in the form of `N/4`. Here `N/4` is ```8/4 = 2```, which means the `0th` and `2th` elements, `1st` and `3th` and so on are compared and swapped if necessary.

Now after second stage the array is in this form:

| 11  | 10  | 12  | 15  | 35  | 19  | 50  | 44  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

#### Stage 3: Again Divide when the interval `1`

In this stage the unsorted array is again divided in the form of `N/8`. Here `N/8` is ```8/8 = 1```, which means the `0th` and `1th` elements, `1st` and `2th` and so on are compared and swapped if necessary.

Now after final stage the array is in this form:

| 10  | 11  | 12  | 15  | 19  | 35  | 44  | 50  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

After the final process the unsorted array is sorted.

## Alogrithm

- Divide the array in the form of ```N/2 (where N is the length of array)```.
- Compare the elements and swap like ```0th element with 4th```,```1st and 5th``` and so on.
- Now again divide the array in the form of ```N/4 (where N is the length of array)```.
- Compare the elements and swap.
- Continue the steps of dividing till the elements are compared with interval of `1`.

/*
*Shell Sort is a very efficient sorting algorithm based on insertion sort technique.
*
*Shell Sort is more effective than insertion sort as
*sometimes in Insertion Sorting, we shift a large block to insert an item at the right place
*as per the sorting order,
*which can be avoided by using the Shell Sort algorithm.
*
*In Shell Sort, the sorting is done at certain intervals/gaps and everytime, this gap is reduced.
*This way, Shell Sort becomes nearly twice as fast as Insertion Sort.
