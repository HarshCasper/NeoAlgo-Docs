## Introduction

A simple sorting algorithm which works on the idea of picking elements from the unsorted part one by one and inserting them into their right positions in the sorted part. The array is virtually divided into 2 parts, a sorted one and an unsorted one. Just like we arrange a group of shuffled pages according to their page numbers, values form unsorted part are picked and placed at the right positions in the sorted portion.

## Algorithm

For sorting an array of size n in ascending order:
- Start your loop from `arr[1]` till `arr[n]`.
- Compare the selected element of the current iteration (key) to the element before it.
- If this key is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before the predecessor.
- Shift all the greater elements up by one position to make space for the smaller element.

// EXECUTION OF INSERTION SORT IN C++

/*First we  will  compare first element in the list with its adjacent element.
And at every comparison if the element can be inserted at a particular position, 
then it is inserted by shifting the other elements one position to the right.
The above steps are repeated until all the elements in the list are in their 
appropriate position.i.e. list is in sorted order.*/

## Sample I/O

### Sample Input

```bash
5
3
1
9
8
2
4
7
```

### Sample Output

```bash
Before Insertion sort: 
5   3   1   9   8   2   4   7
After Insertion sort: 
1   2   3   4   5   7   8   9
```

## Complexity Analysis

- `n` is the number of elements in the array.

- Time Complexity:

  - **Best Case**: O (n)
  - **Average Case**: O (n<sup>2</sup>)
  - **Worst Case**: O (n<sup>2</sup>)

- Space Complexity: O (1)
