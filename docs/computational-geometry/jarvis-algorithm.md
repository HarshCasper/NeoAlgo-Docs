## Introduction

Jarvis Algorithm is **Computational Geometry** Algorithm known for finding the `convex hull` of the given set of points.
This Algorithm is also known by several other names, including the _`Jarvis March Algorithm`_(In the two-dimensional case) and the _`Gift Wrap Algorithm`_.

Can be expanded to multiple dimensions. In 3 dimensions:

- Pick 3 points that form a face and act as a leftmost plane.
- Pick half planes in a similar fashion to picking leftmost lines.
