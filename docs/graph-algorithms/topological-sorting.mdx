## Introduction

Topological Sorting of a Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG), `G = (V, E)` is a linear ordering of all its vertices such that if `G` contains an edge `(u, v)`, then `u` appears before `v` in the ordering. A Topological Ordering is possible if and only if the graph `G` has no directed cycles, that is, `G` is a `DAG`. More than one Topological Sorting can exist for a graph.

## Explanation

Let us have one example: 

```
Given a graph G = (V, E), where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges present in G.

Let G be:

         1-------*0------*3
         *\       |\      |
         | \	  | \	  |
         |  \	  |  \	  |
         |   \	  |   \   |
         |    \	  |    \  |	 
         |     \  *     * *
         2      * 5*------4

Here * represents the direction of the egdes.

The topological sorting of this graph is: 2 1 0 3 4 5

We can see that, there is an edge (1, 5) in the graph and 1 appears before 5 in the topological
sorting.

This follows for all the edges in the graph.

Let us run through the process.

- We start from vertex 2 here. Mark it as visited. 
- Vertex 1 is adjacent to 2. Mark 1 as visited.
- Now we have vertex 0 and 5 adjacent to 1. We can choose any one of them. Let us choose 5, mark it
  as visited.
- Now, since there is no vertex adjacent to 5, we push it into the stack. Stack - [5].
- Now, we go back to 1. From here go to 0, and mark it as visited. We have vertex 3 and 4 both
  adjacent to 0. We can choose any one of them. Let us choose 3, mark it as visited.
- Now 4 is adjacent to 3, mark it as visited. Since there is no vertex adjacent to 4, we push it to
  the stack. Stack - [4, 5].
- Now we go back to 3. Since all of its adjacent vertices have been visited, we push it to the
  stack. Stack - [3, 4, 5].
- Similarly, go back to the starting vertex i.e., 2, and push the vertices to the stack
  accordingly. Stack - [2, 1, 0, 3, 4, 5]. 
- Pop and print the elements of the stack to get the topological sorting of vertices of the graph.
```

## Algorithm

We use the `Depth-First Search(DFS)` algorithm to get the topological sorting of vertices of the graph. In `DFS`, we start from a vertex `v`, mark it as visited. Then, recursively visit all the vertices adjacent to `v` till the adjaceney list of `v` is completely visited and push it to the stack. The elements of the stack are popped and printed to get the topological sorting of vertices of the graph.

  - Call `DFS(G)`.
  - Insert a vertex into the `stack` after its adjacency list has been visited.
  - return the `stack`.
  - Pop the elements of the `stack` and print them to get the `topological sorting` of vertices of the graph.

## Complexity Analysis

  - Time complexity: `O(V + E)`
  - Space complexity: `O(V)`

here `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges in the graph.
