## Introduction

Fractional Knapsack is a `greedy` approach to optimize the value of materials which fit in a knapsack of fixed volume.

## Explanation

* Compute the value per ```Profit upon Weight(Vi/Wi)``` for each item.
* As a Greedy Strategy, we take the item with the highest ```Profit upon Weight``` ratio.
* If the supply of that element is exhausted and we can still carry more, we take as much as possible of the element with the next ```Profit upon Weight``` ratio.

## Quick Example :

In this example we shall find out the maximum profit of the items.
Consider, number of items as 5, and Max Weight as 100.

Item | A | B | C | D | E |
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |---
Weight | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 |
Profit | 20 | 30 | 66 | 40 | 60 |

**First approach: Taking Weights into consideration**

In terms of weights the items with highest weights are `D`, `C`, `B`, `A`. The total profit is `156`(40+66+30+20).

**Second approach: Taking Profit into consideration**

In terms of profit the items with highest profits are ```50% of D```, `E`, `C`. Here if ```100% of D``` is taken then the total weight will exceed `100`. Now since ```50% of D``` is taken so the profit of `D` will also be `50%`. The total profit is `146`(20+60+66).

**Third approach: Taking Profit/Weight(Knapsack approach) into consideration**

Item | A | B | C | D | E |
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |---
Weight | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 |
Profit | 20 | 30 | 66 | 40 | 60 |
Profit/Weight | 2.0 | 1.5 | 2.2 | 1.1 | 1.2 |

In terms of profit/weight the items with highest profit/weight are ```80% of E```, `B`, `A`, 'C'. Here if ```100% of E``` is taken then the total weight will exceed `100`. Now since ```80% of E``` is taken so the profit of `E` will also be `80%`. The total profit is `164`(48+30+20+66).

Since the profit obtained is greater than both the above approaches therefore, we can rightly use ```Fractional Knapsack```.

## Algorithm

- Find the `profit/weight` ratio for each given item.
- Sort the items based on the ratio of `profit/weight`.
- Then start picking up the item with the highest `ratio` until that item is completely taken up. After that we will move to the next highest.
