title: Depth First Search
slug: /graph-algorithms/depth-first-search

## Introduction

Depth First Search or DFS uses stack data structure. The algorithm starts with an initial node of the Graph and goes deeper and deeper until it finds a node that has no children called the **dead node**. Then it starts backtracking from the dead node towards the most recent
node that is yet to be completely unexplored. Here the unvisited nodes are named as **discovery edges** while the ones that lead to an already visited node are called **block edges**.

## How does is work?

Consider a six node graph where the number of edges are four:
- Edge from `vertex A to vertex B`
- Edge from `vertex B to vertex C`
- Edge from `vertex A to vertex C`
- Edge from `vertex D to vertex E`

### The depth first traversal of the above will be as follows:

## Algorithm

- Set status as ready state for each node in the Graph. 
- Push the first node to the stack and set its status as waiting state.
- Pop the top node and after processing set its status as processed state.
- push on the stack all the neighbours of top node that are in the ready state.
- change the status of the top node and set its status to waiting state.
- Repeat the steps until the stack is empty.

## Complexity Analysis

Here V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(V+E)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(V)`
