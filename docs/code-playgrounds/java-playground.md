Run your Java code on the fly with the **Java Plaground**. The Java Playground currently supports Java programming language and you can use the live interactive code editor to test your algorithmic skills. We are using [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) for our purpose and it is highly advisable to have your progress saved by remixing the Trinket. Happy Hacking!
