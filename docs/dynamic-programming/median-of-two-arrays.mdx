title: Median of Two Arrays
slug: /dynamic-programming/median-of-two-arrays

## Introduction

This is an algorithm by which two sorted or two unsorted arrys are merged and then the median of two arrays is found.
This can be done either by a  linear and simpler approach or by mathematical approach.

## Explanation

* Taking a third array, merge the two arrays.
* Then sort the arrays in ascending or descending order.
* There are two cases: 

- **Case 1:** m+n is odd, the median is at (m+n)/2 th index in the array obtained after merging both the arrays.
- **Case 2:** m+n is even, the median will be average of elements at index ((m+n)/2 – 1) and (m+n)/2 in the array obtained after merging both the arrays.

## Quick Example :

Consider two arrays:

A | -5 | 3 | 6 | 12 | 15 |
B | -12 | -10 | -6 | -3 | 4 | 10 |

* Now in a third array merge the `A` and `B`.

C | -5 | 3 | 6 | 12 | 15 | -12 | -10 | -6 | -3 | 4 | 10 |

* Now sort C

C | -12 | -10 | -6 | -5 | -3 | 3 | 4 | 6 | 10 | 12 | 15 |

* Since the length of `C` is 11 which is odd therefore we will use (m+n)/2 to find the median (where `m` and `n` are lengths of `A` and `B` respectively).
* `m` is `5` and `n` is `6`
* Therefore the `median` of the merged arrays is `(5+6)/2` which is 5.5. Since there is no index number with decimal number so everytime we take the `ceil` value.
* Therefore the ```median of two arrays``` is `6th` element i.e, `3`. 

## Algorithm

- Given two arrays are sorted. So they can be merged in O(m+n) time. Create a variable count to have a count of elements in the output array.
- If the value of (m+n) is odd then there is only one median else the median is the average of elements at index (m+n)/2 and ((m+n)/2 – 1).
- To merge the both arrays, keep two indices i and j initially assigned to 0. Compare the ith index of 1st array and jth index of second, increase the index of the smallest element and increase the count.
- Check if the count reached (m+n) / 2 if (m+n) is odd and store the element, if even store the average of (m+n)/2 th and (m+n)/2 -1 th element and print it.
