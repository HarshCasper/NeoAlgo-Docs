## Introduction

Given an array of `n` integers, we need to find the sum of the maximum sum subsequence of the given array such that the integers in the subsequnece are increasing in value.

## Explanation

For Example,

```
Consider an array [6, 107, 8, 9, 106, 10, 11]

In this array, the maximum sum formed by an increasing sequence is 130 formed by [7, 8, 9, 106]
```

## Algorithm

Let us assume that the given array be `arr`,

-   Set `n` the length of the array `arr`
-   Declare `max_sum` and assign it a value of `0`
-   Declare an array of length `n` named `dp` and assign every element of it a value of `0`
-   Set `i`, the value of `0`
-   Iterate a While loop till `i` is less than `n`
    -   Assign `dp[i]`, the value of `arr[i]`
-   Set `i`, the value of `0`
-   Iterate a While loop till `i` is less than `n`
    -   Set `j`, the value of `i`
    -   Iterate a While loop till `j` is less than `i`
    -   If `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` and `dp[i]` is less than `dp[i] + arr[i]`
        -   Set `dp[i]`the value `dp[j]` + `arr[i]`
-   Find the maximum element in the array `dp` and assign it to `max_sum`
-   Return `max_sum`

## Sample Input and Output

#### Input

```
What is the length of the array? 10
Enter the numbers: 23 14 5 84 24 222 321 43 123 432
```

#### Output

```
The maximum sum of an increasing subsequence of the given array is 1082
```

## Complexity Analysis

-   Time complexity - `O(n ^ 2)`, where `n` is the given number
-   Space complexity - `O(n)`
