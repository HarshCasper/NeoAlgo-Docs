## Introduction

Given a knapsack of weight W and n number of items, we need to calculate the maximum value of the items that can be packed into the knapsack such that we can choose any item any number of times. Here we assume that each item has an infinite supply.

## Explanation

 We use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We start from the nth item. There are two possibilities at each step: the weight of the item is less than the knapsack W or greater than the weight of the knapsack W. If the weight of the item is greater than the weight of the knapsack W, then we cannot include the item in it. But if the weight is less than the weight of the knapsack, then we again have two choices to maximize the value of the knapsack: we either choose it or not. If we donot choose it, then the next time we select from n-1 items available to us. If we choose the nth item, then next time we can choose from n items again. So there is a problem of smaller sub problems and so dynamic programming can be used to solve the problem.

## Examples

#### Example 1

```
Let capacity W be 50 and  number of items be 2.
The weights are 5, 10.
The values are  50, 100.
We start from the nth item whose weight is 10 which is less than W. So we can either choose it or not depending on what will maximise the value of the knapsack.
We get greater value when including the nth item than when we get by excluding it.
The maximum value comes out to be 5*100=500.
```
#### Example 2

```
Let capacity W be 5 and number of items be 2.
The weights are 3,5.
The values of items are 10,15.
We start from the nth item whose weight is equal to the knapsack W, so we may either include it or exclude it. If we include it the value of the knapsack will be `15`, but if we exclude it the value of the knapsack will be 10. 
So the maximum value of the knapsack will be 15.
```

## Algorithm

- Create a table (let it be called dp here). In this table `dp[i][j]` will represent the value of the knapsack if there are `i` items and the weight of the knapsack is `j`.
- Identify the base conditions: if the weight of the knapsack is zero, but the number of items is not zero, then the value of knapsack will be zero and if the weight of the knapsack is not zero but the number of items is zero then value will be zero.
- Through looping assign the values to each position in the table.
- If the weight of the item is less than the weight of the knapsack then compare the value of the knapsack when the item is included with the value when the item is excluded.
  If the item is included, then we again choose from the n items.
- If the weight of item is greater than the weight of the knapsack then we have to exclude the item and choose from other n-1 items.
- Return the value of the last position in the table as it is the maximum value of the knapsack.
