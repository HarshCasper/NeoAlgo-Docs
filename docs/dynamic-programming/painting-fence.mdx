## Introduction

Given a fence with `n` posts and `k` colors , find out the number of ways of painting the fence such that atmost `2` adjacent posts have the same color.

## Explanation

Suppose we have a single post, The number of ways of painting the fence with `k` colors is `k` Now we consider `2` posts, Then the number of ways of painting the second fence with the same color as the first post is `k`, and the number of ways of painting the second post with a different color is `k*(k-1)` as we have `k-1` colors that are different from the first post's color. So the total number of ways of painting `2` fences is `k*(k-1) + k`. Now we consider `3` posts, Then the number of ways of painting the third fence same as the second fence is the number of ways of painting the second fence with a different color that is `k*(k-1)`. The number of ways of painting the third fence using a different color is equal to the `total number of ways of painting the second fence * (k-1)`. Hence the total number of ways of painting `3` fences is `k*(k-1) + (k+k*(k-1))*(k-1)`. This way we can find the total number of ways of painting n fences

## Algorithm

- if `n < 2` or `k < n/2` then
    - not possible 
- declare three arrays `total`,`same`,`diff` of length `n-1` 
- initialise `same[0]` to `k`
- initialise `diff[0]` to `k*(k-1)`
- initialise `total[0]` to `k*k`
- loop from `i = 1` to `n-1`
    - `same[i] = diff[i-1]`
    - `diff[i] = total[i-1]*(k-1)`
    - `total[i] = same[i] + diff[i]`
- return `total[n-2]`

## Sample Input and Output

#### Input

```
Enter n,Number of Posts
3
Enter k,Number of Colors
5
```

#### Output

```
Number of Possiblities: 120
```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity - O(`n`)
- Space complexity - O(`n`), where `n` is the number of posts
