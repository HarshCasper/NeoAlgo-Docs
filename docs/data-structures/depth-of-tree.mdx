## Introduction

The maximum depth of a tree/ height of a tree is the number of edges between the tree's root and its furthest leaf. In contrast, the depth of a node is the number of edges in the path from the root node to that node.

## Explanation

To understand better, let us take an example of a tree.

- **Maximum Depth of Tree/ Height of Tree**
  * In the above example, as we can see, `Node A` is the root node and `Node G` and `Node H` are the tree's leaf nodes. Here `Node F` is a leaf node as well, but to find the maximum depth of the tree, we take only the leaf nodes which are furthest from the root node, so in this example, we will neglect the Node F to find the depth.
  * Now just by looking at the definition, we can conclude that the maximum depth of the tree is 3 as there are 3 edges between the root node and the furthest leaves.

- **Depth of a Node**
  * According to the definition, we can find every node's depth by counting the number of edges from the root node to that node. In the above example, as we can see, `Node A` is the root node, so the number of edges in the path from the root node that is Node A to Node A is 0. So the depth of Node A is `0`.
  * Similarly for `Node B`, the number of edges in the path from Node A to Node B is 1. So the depth of Node B is `1`. 
  * We can find the depth of the rest of the nodes in the similar fashion.

## Algorithm

In this section, we will discuss about the algorithmic steps performed to find the depth of tree.

#### Maximum Depth of Tree

* If the root is null, then the depth of the tree is `0`.
* Else, start from the root and, 
  * Recursively find the maximum depth of the left sub-tree.
  * Recursively find the maximum depth of right sub-there.
* Obtain the larger depth out of them and increment it by one.

#### Depth of a Node

* If the root is null, return `-1`.
* If the root is equal to the value of the node who's depth we are supposed to find, print depth = 0.
* Else, recursively check if the node is present in either of the sub-trees.
* If found, calculate the distance between the root node and the given node.
