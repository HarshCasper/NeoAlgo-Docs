## Introduction

A palindrome is a word or combination of characters that read the same forward and backward. Whether a linked list is palindromic or not can be found out using stacks - a data structure. Stacks follow the rule of `Last In First Out`, popularly known as `LIFO`.

## Algorithm

- Create a linked list and initialize a stack.

- Push the data of each node in the linked list into the stack till the end.

- Initialize a pointer to the head of the linked list.

- Initialize a temporary variable and store the data present at the top of the stack. Remember that this data is actually the data of the last node of the linked list.

- Compare the value in the temporary variable with that of the node pointed to by the pointer in the linked list. Remember that the pointer points to the head , that is, the first node of the linked list.

- If the two values are the same, then move onto the next node in the linked list and pop the current top element in the stack.

- Repeat step 6 till the end of the stack or linked list is reached or the two values being compared are not the same.

- If the end of the linked list is reached, then it means that the linked list is palindromic. Otherwise it is not palindromic.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Let the linked list be 1->2->3
All the data is pushed into the stack in the order: 3 2 1 with 1 at the bottom and 3 at top
The pointer points towards the head of the linked list that is 1
It is now compared with the top of the stack which is 3, so they are not equal and hence linked list is not palindrome.
```

### Example 2

```
Let the linked list be 1->2->1
All the data is pushed into the stack 
Compare the top of the stack(=1) with the data at head of the linked list.
As they are equal, pop the current top of the stack and pointer points towards the next node(=2)
Again both are equal. Repeat the above step again. 
You have reached the end of the linked list. Therefore, it is palindromic.
```
