# Introduction

A palindrome is a word or combination of characters that read the same forward and backward.
Whether a linked list is palindromic or not can be found out using stacks - a data structure. Stacks follow the rule of 'Last In First Out',
popularly known as 'LIFO'.

# Algorithm

1. Create a linked list
2. Initialize a stack
3. Push the data of each node in the linked list into the stack till the end
4. Initialize a pointer to the head of the linked list
5. Initialize a temporary variable and store the data present at the top of the stack.
   Remember that this data is actually the data of the last node of the linked list.
6. Compare the value in the temporary variable with that of the node pointed to by the pointer in the linked list
   Remember that the pointer points to the head , that is, the first node of the linked list.
7. If the two values are the same, then move onto the next node in the linked list and pop the current top element in the stack.
   Repeat step 6 till the end of the stack or linked list is reached or the two values being compared are not the same.
8. If the end of the linked list is reached, then it means that the linked list is palindromic. Otherwise it is not palindromic.

# Examples

## Example 1

Let the linked list be 1->2->3
All the data is pushed into the stack in the order: 3 2 1 with 1 at the bottom and 3 at top
The pointer points towards the head of the linked list that is 1
It is now compared with the top of the stack which is 3, so they are not equal and hence linked list is not palindrome.

## Example 2

Let the linked list be 1->2->1
All the data is pushed into the stack 
Compare the top of the stack(=1) with the data at head of the linked list.
As they are equal, pop the current top of the stack and pointer points towards the next node(=2)
Again both are equal. Repeat the above step again. 
You have reached the end of the linked list. Therefore, it is palindromic.
