## Introduction

A program is a set of instructions that performs operations on data. The way of organizing this data in the main memory at the time of execution of the program is called as ***data structures*** .

Depending upon the requirement of a program and the type of procedures it is performing, we have various data structures. Some of the common examples of data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees and graphs. Data structures are widely applied in the following areas: 
* Compiler design  
* Operating system
* DBMS
* Simulation
* Artificial intelligence 
* Graphics

## Classification of Data Structures

Data structures are classified into two classes: 

### ***Primitive and Non-primitive Data Structures*** 

Primitive data structures are the basic data types of any programming
language that form the basic unit for the data structures. Some basic data types are integer, float, character and boolean.           
    Non-primitive data structures are complex structures that are created using primitive data structures. Examples of such data structures include Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, and Graphs.

 Based on the above structure and arrangement of data, non-primitive data structures are further classified into linear and non-linear.

 ### ***Linear and Non-linear Structures***
Linear data structures are those where data can be processed in a linear fashion i.e one by one sequentially. It includes the following types of data structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks & Queues.     
    Non-linear structures are those in which insertion and deletion are not possible in a linear fashion. It includes the following types of data structures: Trees & Graphs.

## Major Operations on Data Structures

This section discusses the different operations that can be performed on various data structures.

* ***Traversing : *** 
Accessing each record or element from a given file exactly once in order to process it is called traversing. For example, to print the marks of all the students in a class.

* ***Searching : ***
Finding the location of a given key value in a collection of various data items.
It can be possible that the given key-value may or may not be present in that collection. For example, to find the names of all the people who live in a particular house.

* ***Inserting : *** 
Adding a new element into existing files. For example, to add a particular data of a given student who has just enrolled in a school/college.

* ***Deleting : ***
Removing the elements from a collection of various data items. For example, to delete the data of a student who has dropped out of a school/college.

* ***Sorting : *** 
Arranging the elements in the file or structure either in some logical order (alphabetically increasing order, decreasing order) or mathematical order. For example, arranging a deck of cards in ascending or descending order.

* ***Merging : ***
Combining the elements of two similar data structures to a new data structure of the same type. For example, when two lists `List A` and `List B` of size `P` and `Q` respectively, of similar type of elements, are joined to produce the third list, `List C` of size `(P+Q)`, then this process is called merging.

## Advantages of Data Structures

Given below are some important ***advantages of data structures***: 

* Proper choice of data structures makes the program efficient in terms of space and time complexity.
* It provides effective and efficient processing of small as well as a large amount of data.
* They are re-usable.
* They make the code cleaner and easier to understand.
* Data structures are specified by an ADT (Abstract Data Type) which provides a level of abstraction.
