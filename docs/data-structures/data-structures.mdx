## Introduction

A ***data structure*** is basically a group of data elements that are put together under one name, and
which defines a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used
efficiently. 

Data structures are used in almost every program or software system. Some common examples of
data structures are arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks, binary trees, and hash tables. Data structures
are widely applied in the following areas:
* Compiler design  
* Operating system
* DBMS
* Simulation
* Artificial intelligence 
* Graphics

## Classification of Data Structures

Data structures are generally categorized into two classes: primitive and non-primitive data
structures.

#### ***Primitive and Non-primitive Data Structures*** 

Primitive data structures are the fundamental data types which are supported by a programming
language. Some basic data types are integer, float, character and boolean.
Non-primitive data structures are those data structures which are created using primitive data
structures. Examples of such data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

 Based on the structure and arrangement of data, non primitive data structures are further classified into linear and non-linear.

 #### ***Linear and Non-linear Structures***
If the elements of a data structure are stored in a linear or sequential order, then it is a linear data
structure. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
However, if the elements of a data structure are not stored in a sequential order, then it is a
non-linear data structure. The relationship of adjacency is not maintained between elements of a
non-linear data structure. Examples include trees and graphs.

## Major Operations in Data Structures

This section discusses the different operations that can be performed on various data structures.

* #### **Traversing** 
It means to access each data item exactly once so that it can be processed. For
example, to print the names of all the students in a class.

* #### **Searching**
It is used to find the location of one or more data items that satisfy the given constraint.
Such a data item may or may not be present in the given collection of data items. For example,
to find the names of all the students who secured 100 marks in science.

* #### **Inserting** 
It is used to add new data items to the given list of data items. For example, to add
the details of a new student who has recently joined the course.

* #### **Deleting**
It means to remove (delete) a particular data item from the given collection of data
items. For example, to delete the name of a student who has left the course.

* #### **Sorting** 
Data items can be arranged in some order like ascending order or descending order
depending on the type of application. For example, arranging the names of students in a class in
an alphabetical order, or calculating the top three winners by arranging the participantsâ€™ scores in
descending order and then extracting the top three.

* #### **Merging**
Lists of two sorted data items can be combined to form a single list of sorted data items.
For example, when two lists `List A` and `List B` of size `P` and `Q` respectively, of similar type of elements are joined to produce the third list, `List C` of size `(P+Q)`, then this process is called merging.

Many a time, two or more operations are applied simultaneously in a given situation. For
example, if we want to delete the details of a student whose name is X, then we first have to
search the list of students to find whether the record of X exists or not and if it exists then at which
location, so that the details can be deleted from that particular location.

## Advantages of Data Structures

Given below are some important ***advantages of data structures***: 

* **Efficiency** : 
    * Proper choice of data structures makes program efficient in terms of space and time.
    * It provides effective and efficient processing of small as well as large amount of data such as large databases and indexing services such as hash table.
    * With efficient use of data structure memory usage can be optimized.

* **Reusability** : 
    *  Data structures can be reused, i.e. once we have implemented a particular data structure, we can use it at any other place.
    * Implementation of data structures can be compiled into libraries which can be used by different clients.

* **Abstraction** : 
    * Data structures are specified by an ADT(Abstract Data Type) which provides a level of abstraction.
    * ADT is theoretical and data structure gives physical form to them.
