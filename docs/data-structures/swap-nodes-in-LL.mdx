title: Swapping Nodes in Linked List
slug: /graph-algorithms/swap-nodes-in-LL

## Introduction

Given a singly linked list of integers along with two integers 'i' and 'j'. 
Swap the nodes that are present at the 'ith' and 'jth' positions without swapping the data of those nodes.

## Explanation

Let us suppose we are given a linked list like the one shown in the figure.

Now, given `i = B` and `j = D`, we have to swap both the nodes which means that we have to change the links of those nodes.

After swapping both of them, the output will be :

## Algorithm

* Input the nodes from user of the positions which are to be swapped.
* Let i and j be the nodes which needs to be swapped.
* Check whether the list is empty:
  * If yes, return;
  * Else, search for i and j by traversing through the list.
  * If any of them does not exist in the list, then exit out of the function.
* Now check whether previous node of i is not NULL and set `previous node1->next` to `j`.
* Similarly check if previous node of j is not NULL and set `previous node2->next` to `i`.
* Now, swap next nodes of i and j.

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: `O(N)` where `N` is the size of singly linked list.
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`
