title: Infix to Postfix Conversion
slug: /data-structures/infix-to-postfix

## Introduction

An infix expression is of the form: `operand1 operator operand2`, whereas a postfix expression is of the form `operand1 operand2 operator`. Converting an infix expression to postfix expression is one of the many applications of stacks due to its 'Last in First Out' policy.

## Algorithm

- Initialize a stack.
- Scan the element from left to right.
- If the scanned element is a '(' push to stack.
- If scanned element is a '), pop and output contents of stack till empty or '(' is encountered.
- If scanned element is an operand output it.
- If scanned element is an operator, then check for precedence.
- If the precedence of scanned elements is less than the precedence of the operators in the stack then pop and output.
- If the precedence of scanned elements is greater than the precedence of the operators in the stack then push into stack.

## Examples

#### Example 1

```
Let the string entered be `A+B`.
The first scanned element is `A`, an operand, so it is printed.
The second element `+` is an operator and the stack is empty, so it is pushed into stack.
The third element `B` is an operand and is printed.
No other element left to be scanned.
The operator from stack is popped and printed.
The output is `AB+`.
```

#### Example 2

```
Let the string be `a+b*c`.
`a` is printed and `+` is pushed into the stack.
`b` is also printed.
`*` is an operator and its precedence is compared with taht of the top of the stack.
`*` is of greater precedence than `+`,, so it is pushed into stack.
`c` is printed.
The top element of the stack is popped and printed till stack is empty.
The output is `abc*+`.
```

## Sample I/O

#### Input

```
Enter the string: 
a+b+(c*d)
```

### Output

```
Postfix Expression: ab+cd*+
```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`

- Space Complexity: `O(n)`
