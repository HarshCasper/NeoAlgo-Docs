## Introduction

Given an integer, reverse its bits in its binary equivalent and obtain the reversed number's decimal equivalent.

## Explanation

Consider a number `n` = `13`.

```
The binary equivalent of the number is 1101
Its reverse is 1011

The decimal equivalent of 1011 is 11.
```

Hence the number obtained by reversing the bits of the number `13` is `11`.

## Algorithm

Let us assume that the given number be `num`,

-   Declare `rem`
-   Declare a variable `rev` and set its value to 0.
-   Begin a While loop till `num` greater than `0`
    -   Left shift `rev` by `1` place
    -   Set `rem` the bitwise AND of `num` and `1`
    -   Set `rev` the bitwise OR of `rem` and `rev`
    -   Set `n` the value of `n` right shifted by `1` place
-   Return `rev`

## Sample Input and Output

#### Input

```
Enter the number? 39
```

#### Output

```
The bits-reversed number is: 57
```

## Complexity Analysis

-   Time complexity - `O(n)`, where `n` is the given number
-   Space complexity - `O(1)`
