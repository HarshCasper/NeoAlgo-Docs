## Introduction

Given a number, toggle the `k`'th bit of the given number, i.e. If the `k`th bit is `1` toggle it to `0` else if it is `0`, toggle it to `1`. 

## Explanation

Consider a number `n` = `24`. Assume that we have to toggle the `k` = `3`th bit.

```
Consider n = 24,  k = 3

Binary equivalent of n = 11000
Here the third bit is '0'. So we need to toggle it to '1'.

Binary equivalent of n after toggling its third bit(from the LSB) = 11100 (28)
```

Hence `28` is the number obtained after toggling the k'th bit.

## Algorithm

Let us assume that the given number be `n` and the value of k be `k`

-   Set `temp` the value of 1 with its bits shifted to left by `k-1` places
-   Set `ans` the value of `n` xor `temp`
-   Return `ans`

 Program to Toggle kth bit of a number.
 Given a number we want to toggle the kth  bit of a number .

  Ex:-6 (110) and k=2
     after toggling  2nd bit our number would be (100) 4.
 Approach:
  firstly we will left shift the given number k-1 times.
  After then we will xor the left shifted result with given number and return

## Sample Input and Output

#### Input

```
Enter the number: 33
Enter the value of k(where you need to toggle the k'th bit): 12
```

#### Output

```
The given number, after toggling the k-th bit is 2081.
```
