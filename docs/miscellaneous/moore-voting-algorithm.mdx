title: Finding out the majority element using Moore's voting algorithm

## Introduction

The most common algorithm to find the majority element is to keep a count of the frequency of each element in the array and then decide which has the greatest frequency. This has a time complexity of `O(n^2)`. But a faster algorithm exists, called `Moore's Voting algorithm` which reduces the time complexity to `O(n)`. 

## Algorithm

- Scan each element in the array
- Maintain a count for majority element and a majority index
- If the next element is same then increment the count otherwise decrement the count.
- If the count reaches to 0 then change the majority index and set the count to 1.
- Return the element at the majority index.
- Scan through the original array and count the number of occurences of the element at the majority index.
- If the frequency is greater than half the size of the array then, it is the majority element otherwise there is none.

## Examples

#### Example 1

```
Let the array be `1,2,2`.
Initially the majority index is `0`.
The element at the majority index is equal to the element in position `0`, hence count increments.
Next element `2` is not the same as the majority index. Count decrements.
Next element `2` is not same as majority index again. Count decrements to `0`.
Majority index is changed to `2` and the element at majority index is returned.
`2` occurs twice, so it is the majority element.
```

#### Example 2

```
Let the array be `2,3`.
Initially the majority index is `0`.
The element at the majority index is equal to the element in position `0`, hence count increments.
Next element is not the same as that at the majority index, hence count decrements to `0`.
Majority index is changed to `1`.
`3` occurs only once, hence no majority element exists.
```

//Driver code

    int n;
    cin >> n;
    cout<<"\nEnter the elements: ";
    int a[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> a[i];
    int res = maxFrequencyElement(a, n);
    if (res == -1)
        cout << "Majority element not found\n";
    else
        cout << "Majority element: "<< res << "\n";
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Sample I/O

#### Input

```
Enter the number of elements: 3
Enter the elements: 1 2 2
```

#### Output

```
Majority element: 2
```

## Complexity analysis

- Time Complexity: `O(n)`

- Space Complexity: `O(1)`
